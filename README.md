# fruity.js
Fruitify your site!  

fruity.js is a short Javascript library that I created just for fun!  

To try it out, go to [my website](lzil.github.io), and type `fruit`.
You'll be able to see what happens ;)

Some features of fruity.js include:
* turns about a third of the words currently on the screen into names of fruits (hardcoded, of course...)
* renders the images on the page to be more pastel-y and fruity
* all links now link to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit)
* changes background color schemes to bright pastel colors

Future proposed changes:  
* play soft, fresh music in the background (have no idea what I'll do for this yet)  

To include fruity.js in your site, simply include:
```
<script src="http://rawgit.com/lzil/fruity.js/master/fruity.js">
```
in your HTML header!
